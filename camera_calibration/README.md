# Camera Calibration
In case you don't have the intrinsics of your camera, we provide the script to get them.

### How to use it
- Print the checkboard provided and use you camera to take tens of images from different view angle
- Store those images in jpg format to images folder
- Run find_intrinsics.py
- camera_intrinsics.json will be stored
